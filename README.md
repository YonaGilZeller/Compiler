# Compiler
This compiler was built as a university project, which compiles an assembly language to binary code written in C.
The fail1, successful1, successful2 files show examples of inputs and outputs of the program run on Ubuntu.

Within the source files can be found a run file for Ubunutu. To try and run the code on another machine the code needs to be recomplied on that machine.
